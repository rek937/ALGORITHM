##### Characteristics of algorithm
1. input --- 0 or more
2. output --- at least one
3. definitence
4. finiteness
5. effectiveness

<br />

##### Analyze a algorithm (Frequency count method)
1. analyze time complexity --- use **O(n)** to ignore some unimportant details (Otto tine)
2. analyze space complexity --- Otto space
3. data transform or network consumption
4. power consumption
5. need how many CPU registecs
